# Background
This repository contains the source data and code to compile a checklist of flowering plants recorded in the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana). It was developed for [Flora of the Guianas Consortium]( https://www.naturalis.nl/en/science/flora-of-guianas).

## Workflow
- Data retrieval (POWO, Tropicos, WFO, GBIF) → Data cleaning → Mapping to Darwin Core → Dataset integration → Manual quality control → Compute indicators of [content quality](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biaf191/8442886) and [governance](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biaf071/8443372) for the checklist
